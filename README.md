# React Web Project: Feed
## ðŸ“– About the project
This project is a web application that replicates a social media "Feed" page. Users can engage with the content by commenting, liking posts, and performing other typical actions found on social networks. The main objective of this project is to enhance my skills and techniques in React Web development.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
The project was developed using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS)

By utilizing React, Node.js, and CSS, I created a dynamic and interactive web application that allows users to perform specific tasks within the feed interface.
Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
